KNOWLEDGE VENTURES INC LAUNCHES AUTHORITY FINDER - NEW WEBSITE GIVES STUDENTS 
THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO WRITE BETTER TERM PAPERS 

Authority Finder Allows Students To Get Relevant Sources Within Seconds

BOSTON (MA) -- December 12, 2001 -- The Internet has revolutionized
research, allowing easier and greater access to information.  College
students, journalists, and academics are overwhelmed with research
results and many times find themselves with materials they can't use
and find it difficult to obtain what they really need. To solve this
problem, Knowledge Ventures, Inc. an educational tools software
company focused on developing solutions to improve the on-line
research experience has created Authority Finder, a concept based
search engine (www.authorityfinder.com
<http://www.instantknowledge.com>) that gives students, journalists or
anyone looking for sources to support their work the tools and
resources that they need to explore their own ideas and grow them with
relevant materials and articles. What Is Authority Finder?

Authority Finder is a simple and intuitive querying tool that allows
the user to locate relevant quotations and corresponding citations
from a list of authoritative academic journals, in support of key
ideas or thesis statements. Whether writing a term paper, speech,
article or business plan, the user can search relevant quotes or
whole articles to back-up their hypothesis or argument. 

"Most search engines have as a backdrop the Dewey Decimal System or
library approach that only allows students to search using a few
words, titles or names," said Dr. Michael Lissack, founder and
Chairman of Knowledge Ventures. "Authority Finder helps address the
critical need of students, writers and researchers everywhere: 
'I need a quote that says X in order to support my position,' by
searching for relevant sentences rather than a key word". 

What Makes Authority Finder Different?
Authority Finder uses a search engine which allows users to conduct
searches based on natural language using anything from a keyword to a
few sentences of text to yield relevant results. Better than a keyword
or Boolean search, Authority Finder's underlying search engine can
automatically extract an "understanding" of a given query.  Authority
Finder uses language pattern-matching algorithms that convert queries
into a set of statistical patterns or "concept chunks" which are then
used to find similar "chunks" of content within the Authority Finder 
database(s). The results are targeted lists of quotations and sources
within seconds.

Authority Finder can search against multiple textual databases
simultaneously making it a point and click process for the user. Once
the list of potential quotes is retrieved, the results are ranked
within seconds and presented in a list with each quote accompanied by
the author and title information of the particular quote's origin.
Each quote can be clicked to view the entire article from which the
quote was excerpted, with the quote highlighted for one to easily
review its original context. 

The Authority Finder database currently boasts more than 35,000
articles from 250 American and English academic and business journals,
covering a wide range of subjects including: business, medicine, art
history, history, economics, science, technology, education, sociology
and psychology from 1998 to the present. The database is updated
regularly to include the most recent and relevant content from the
data feed of journals.  Material is provided under an agreement with 
the Gale Group (www.galegroup.com).

Users can conduct preliminary searches for free at
www.authorityfinder.com <http://www.instantknowledge.com> or sign-up
for a subscription to gain complete access to their found materials. 
Currently, users can sign up for a 15 day trial for $9.95 and then opt
for two month subscription for $24.95 or six month subscription for
$49.95.
