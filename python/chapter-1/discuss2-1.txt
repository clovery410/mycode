Here is one method to check if a number is prime:

def is_prime(n):
    k = 2
    while k < n:
    	  if n % k == 0:
	     return False
	  k += 1
    return True

Q1:How does this function work?

Q2:This is a decent way of testing if a number is prime, but looping k all the way to n might be a bit cumbersome. As a little bonus question, can you think of a better place to stop?

Answer1: Loop k = k + 1 from initial value 2, and verifying that if n can be divided by k, if yes, return Flase, till k >= n, return True.

Answer2: we can stop at 'the square root of n'
Since if d divides n, then n/d also divides n. d and n/d cannot both be greater than square root(n)
