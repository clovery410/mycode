Q7: The algorithm for computing the UPC check digits ends with the following steps:
Subtract 1 from the total.
Compute the remainder when the adjusted total is divided by 10.
Subtract the remainder from 9.

It's tempting to try to simplify the algorithm by using these steps instead:

Compute the remainder when the total is divided by 10.
Subtract the remainder from 10.

Why doesn't this technique work?


Answer:
first algorithm is 9 - (x - 1) % 10
second algotithm is 10 - x % 10 => 9 - (x % 10 - 1)
So, we can only compare (x - 1) % 10 and (x % 10 - 1), the value of first one is in [0, 9], the value of second one is in [-1, 8], thus, the result of first algorithm is in [0, 9], the result of second algorithm is in [1, 10].
However, our check digit can only be one digit, 10 has two.
