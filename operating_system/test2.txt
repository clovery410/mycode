Three processes are involved in printing a file. Process A reads the file data from the disk to Buffer 1, Process B copies the data from Buffer 1 to Buffer 2, finally Process C takes the data from Buffer 2 and print it.  Assume all three processes operate on one (file) record at a time, both buffers' capacity are one record. Write a program to coordinate the three processes using semaphores.
